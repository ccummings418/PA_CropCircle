## Crop Circle Phenom Excel Macro
#### About the Sensor
The Holland Scientific Crop Circle Phenom is a multiparameter active sensing instrument capable of measuring red, NIR, and red-edge bands as well as climatic and physiological measurements, including upwelling and downwelling PAR, air / canopy temperature and atmospheric pressure.

The readings are measured approximately once per second for each band and are stored in a CSV file. 

#### Use Case for Macro
Since the Crop Circle Phenom instrument combines ACS-430 and DAS43X measurements into one CSV file per log measurement, several pre-processing steps are needed to organize the data. The steps I found useful were: 1.) Combine all the RAW CSV files from each sensing date/ field, 2.) organize the readings by sensor, and 3.)
